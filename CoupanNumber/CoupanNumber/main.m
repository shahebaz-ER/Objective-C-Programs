         Desc -> Given N distinct Coupon Numbers, how many random numbers do you need to generate distinct coupon number? This program simulates this random process.
             I/P -> N Distinct Coupon Number
             Logic -> repeatedly choose a random number and check whether it's a new one.
             O/P -> total random number needed to have all distinct numbers.
             Functions => Write Class Static Functions to generate random number and to process distinct coupons.
