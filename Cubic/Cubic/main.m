      10. Sum of three Integer adds to ZERO
 
            a. Desc -> A program with cubic running time. Read in N integers and counts the  number of triples that sum to exactly 0.
            b. I/P -> N number of integer, and N integer input array
            c. Logic -> Find distinct triples (i, j, k) such that a[i] + a[j] + a[k] = 0
            d. O/P -> One Output is number of distinct triplets as well as the second output is to   print the distinct trniplets.
