    ===========================Problem Statement==================
    25. Find the Fewest Notes to be returned for Vending Machine
  
            a. Desc -> There is 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 Rs Notes which can be
               returned by Vending Machine. Write a Program to calculate the minimum number of Notes as well as the Notes to be returned by the Vending Machine as a Change
            b. I/P -> read the Change in Rs to be returned by the Vending Machine
            c. Logic -> Use Recursion and check for largest value of the Note to return change to get to minimum number of Notes.
            d. O/P -> Two Outputs - one the number of minimum Note needed to give the
                change and second list of Rs Notes that would given in the Change
